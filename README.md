## Why NoSleep?
NoSleep was developed to address a common MacBook issue where the system unexpectedly restarts when connected to external displays. This bug appears to be related to the system's sleep mode. By preventing system sleep while still allowing display sleep, NoSleep provides a simple solution to this frustrating problem.
